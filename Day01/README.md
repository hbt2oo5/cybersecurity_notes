## üìÖ Day 01: Introduction to Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking


#### ‚úÖ What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It encompasses a range of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect information and ensure the safe operation of digital environments.

**Importance:**
- Protects sensitive personal, financial, and organizational data  
- Prevents cyberattacks that can lead to financial losses or reputational damage  
- Ensures operational continuity and system availability  
- Builds trust among users, clients, and stakeholders  

**Scope:**
- **Network Security** ‚Äì Protecting internal networks from intruders  
- **Information Security** ‚Äì Safeguarding data from unauthorized access or alterations  
- **Application Security** ‚Äì Keeping software and devices free of threats  
- **Operational Security** ‚Äì Protecting processes and decisions for handling data  
- **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity** ‚Äì Responding and recovering from security breaches  
- **End-user Education** ‚Äì Training users to recognize and avoid threats

#### üîê Basic Concepts of CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
The **CIA Triad** forms the foundation of all cybersecurity efforts:

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to information. Techniques include encryption, access controls, and authentication.  
- **Integrity:** Ensuring that information is accurate and unaltered during transit or storage. Maintained using hashing, checksums, and version control.  
- **Availability:** Ensuring reliable access to information and systems for authorized users. Supported through failover systems, backups, and DDoS protection.

#### üìã Guidelines for Cybersecurity
- Use strong, unique passwords  
- Keep all systems and software updated  
- Enable firewalls and install reputable antivirus tools  
- Regularly back up critical data  
- Restrict access to sensitive files and systems  
- Conduct regular awareness training for users

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Types of Cybersecurity Threats
- **Phishing:** Deceptive emails or websites that trick users into revealing confidential data  
- **Ransomware:** Malware that encrypts files and demands payment to restore access  
- **Malware:** Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to systems  
- **Social Engineering:** Psychological manipulation to extract confidential information  
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** Intercepting communication between two parties  
- **Zero-Day Attack:** Exploiting unknown or unpatched software vulnerabilities

#### üõ°Ô∏è What Do We Do in Cybersecurity?
- **Protect Data:** Use encryption, access control, and data masking  
- **Monitor Networks:** Use intrusion detection and log analysis tools  
- **Implement Security Measures:** Firewalls, endpoint security, and MFA  
- **Conduct Risk Assessments:** Identify vulnerabilities and evaluate their impact  
- **Incident Response:** Prepare, detect, contain, and recover from cyber incidents  
- **Educate & Train:** Build a culture of security through training programs  
- **Stay Updated:** Follow threat intelligence and security advisories

---

#### üìö Cybersecurity Principles
- **Least Privilege:** Give users the minimum access required  
- **Defense in Depth:** Layered security across endpoints, networks, and data  
- **Fail-Safe Defaults:** Default to deny access unless explicitly allowed  
- **Separation of Duties:** Divide critical tasks among multiple people or systems  
- **Accountability:** Ensure traceability of actions through logging and auditing  
- **Secure by Design:** Build systems with security integrated from the start

### ‚öîÔ∏è Red Team vs. Blue Team vs. Purple Team
| Team | Role | Real-World Scenario | Key Skills |
|------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Red Team** | Offensive security experts who simulate real-world attacks to test defenses. | Simulate phishing and social engineering attacks to gain unauthorized access to systems. | Ethical hacking, penetration testing, social engineering, scripting, exploit development |
| **Blue Team** | Defensive team focused on detecting, responding, and mitigating attacks. | Respond to a detected malware outbreak within an organization‚Äôs internal network. | Network defense, SIEM analysis, threat hunting, incident response, digital forensics |
| **Purple Team** | Bridge between Red and Blue teams to enhance collaboration and efficiency. | After a Red Team assessment, work with Blue Team to close gaps and improve response strategy. | Cross-domain knowledge, communication, detection improvement, scripting, analysis |

#### ‚úÖ Best Practices
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
- Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities  
- Regularly update and patch software  
- Disable unused services and ports  
- Use VPNs when accessing corporate resources remotely  
- Perform regular security audits and penetration testing  
- Establish a clear incident response plan
